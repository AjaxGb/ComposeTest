# ComposeTest

The idea for this command rose out of a discussion on the [/r/MinecraftCommands Discord channel](https://discord.gg/%51AFXFtZ)
involving AmberW and Winter_Snake.

Simply, it takes raw JSON text, like `/tellraw`, parses it, and then evaluates the result as a command.
This allows for many things that could not be done previously, in particular things like summoning a
wolf that is tamed to an arbitrary player, or giving a player their own player head. If text components
for printing UUIDs or NBT were added, this command's capabilities would grow even further.
