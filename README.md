# ComposeTest

The idea for this command rose out of a discussion on the [/r/MinecraftCommands Discord channel](https://discord.gg/%51AFXFtZ)
involving AmberW and Winter_Snake. This mod is intended only as a proof of concept.

Simply, it takes raw JSON text, like `/tellraw`, parses it, and then evaluates the result as a command.
This allows for many things that could not be done previously, in particular things like summoning a
wolf that is tamed to an arbitrary player, or giving a player their own player head. If text components
for printing UUIDs or NBT were added, this command's capabilities would grow even further.

The compiled .jar can be found on the Releases page, or [here](https://github.com/AjaxGb/ComposeTest/releases/download/v1.0/composecommand-1.0.jar).
